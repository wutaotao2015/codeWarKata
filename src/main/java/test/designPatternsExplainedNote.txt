Design Patterns Explained
    A new perspective on Object-Oriented Design

Preface
    can understand 10 most essential design patterns from this book.

    From object orientation to patterns to true object orientation

        patterns are supposed to be sewn together to solve a problem.

        patterns existed at all levels-analysis, design and implementation.
        And in describing the problem itself.

        design patterns can be derived from some basic strategies and principles.

    From artificial intelligence to patterns to true object orientation

chapter 1 the Object-Oriented paradigm

    before the object-oriented paradigm: functional decomposition

        functional decomposition can simplify complex problems, and it is so often and naturally used by us
        that we don't consider other possibilities.

        it can't deal with future changes.

    the problem of requirements

        requirements always change!

        the users' view and developers' view and the developing environment are all possible to change.

    Dealing with changes: using functional decomposition

        functional decomposition's code are often low cohision and tight coupling.
        changes to this kind of code result in unexpected side effects and we have to spend a lot of time
        finding the bugs.

    Dealing with changing requirements

        example: let students to go their next class,and graduate students need to do more work than
        undergraduate students.
        shift responsibility

        1. the students are responsible for themselves, the instructor don't need to control everything
        2. the control program can talk to different types of students as if they are the same.
        3. the control promgram don't need to know specific steps students take.

        three perspectives at software development process:
            conceptual
            specification
            implementation
        communicating at conceptual level while performing at implementation level is very powerful.
        controller only knows what is conceptually happening other than what is exactly happening.

    the object-oriented paradigm

        normally,we get object by finding nouns in requirement and get methods by finding verbs.

        An object is best regarded as something with responsibilities.
        abstract classes are more than classes that can't be instantiated, it is a placeholder for
        other classes at the conceptual level.

        encapsulation is more than hiding data, it means any kind of hiding in general.Such as
        the instructor don't know the student type is undergraduate or graduate.

    object-oriented programming in action

        advantages with encapsulation:
            user don't need to worry about implementation
            implementations can be changed without worrying about caller
            the inside of object are unknown to outside objects using its interface

        For change's side effects problem with the above functional decomposition's changing code,
        object can only be changed by calling its own method, its data and implementation detail are
        shielded from other object's change by encapsulation.
        On the other hand, internal changes made to the object are transparent to other objects as well.

chapter 2 the UML - the unified modeling language

    overview
    What is the UML?
        mainly use Interaction Diagram(sequence diagram), class diagrams, state diagrams
    why use the UML?
        for communication, clarity, precision
    the class diagram
        public +
        protected #
        private -

        class name is italicized means it is an abstract one
        using open (unfilled) diamond to show aggregation relationship
        using filled diamond to show composition relationship
        using a dashed line with an arrow to show a 'use' or dependency relationship

        the note in UML
        cardinality: the number of objects contained or be contained

    interaction diagram

        the object instantiation and messages conveyed between them

    summary
        we can use note to clarify

chapter 3 a problem that cries out for flexible code

    overview
    extracting information from a CAD/CAM system
        expert system are more complex and longer than CAD/CAM system, so the extracting-information
        tool need to be flexible enough for future CAD/CAM system's changes.
    understand the vocabulary
        slot, hole, cutout, special, irregular
        geometry, part, dataset or model, NC machine and NC set(numerically controlled)
    describe the problem
        the features need to be made in right order to make the right part, and this
        order is made by expert system.
    the essential challenges and approaches
        the expert system don't need to know the version of CAD/CAM, and changing CAD's version won't
        need to change the expert system's code.
    summary
        we want to communicate with different implementations in the same way.

chapter 4 A standard object-oriented solution

    overview
    solving with special cases
        each feature has a V1 model and a V2 model
    summary

chapter 5 an introduction to design patterns

    overview
    design patterns arose from architecture and anthropology
        how to desin a great backyard
    moving from architectural to software design patterns
    why study design patterns
        reuse solutions
        establish common terminology
        gives a higher-level perspective, avoid dealing with details too early
    other advantages to studying design patterns
        design to interfaces
        favor composition over inheritance
        find what varies and encapsulate it
    summary

chapter 6 the facade pattern

    overview
    introducing the facade pattern
        a new way or a special way to interact with the system
    learning the facade pattern
        presents a new interface for the clients to use the subsystem.
        consequences: simplified the use of the system, but it only contains part of the system, certain
        functionality may be unavailable.
    field notes: the facade pattern
        we can create this easy new interface because we don't need to use all of the functions
        patterns set a general approach,it's blueprints to get started
        the facade can also be used to hide or encapsulate the old system:
            1. track system usage
            2. swap out systems
    relating the facade pattern to the CAD/CAM problem
        for V1Slot, V1Holes using V1 system, we need to use facade to simplify the usage from its complex
        implementation.
    summary
        the facade pattern applies when:
            you don't need all of the functionality of the complex system
            you want to hide or encapsulate the original system
            you want to use the original system and add some new functionality as well
            the cost of writing this new class is less than learning the original system or maintaining it
chapter 7 the adapter pattern
    overview
    introducing the adapter pattern
        create a new interface for a object which does the right thing but has a wrong interface
    learning the adapter pattern
        by containing the needed class in our new class we can implement the polymorphism as we like.
        the adapter provides a wrapper with the desired interface
        consequeces: allows preexisting objects to fit into new system without the limits of its own interfaces.
    field notes: the adapter pattern
        if the existed object don't have all the functionality we need, we can do it in the wrapper class.
        Object adapter pattern
            one object containing another
        class adapter pattern
            with multiple inheritance

        the differences between facade and adapter
            1. they both have preexisting classes
            2. facade don't need to design to specific interface, and adapter must do.
            3. facade don't need to behave polymorphically, while adapter probably do.
            4. facade need to get a simpler interface, and adapter don't need to.

        bottom line: A facade simplifies an interface while an adapter converts the interface(new) into
        a preexisting interface(old).
    relating the adapter pattern to the CAD/CAM problem
        for V2 system, many features don't have the needed interfaces, so we can use adapter to get
        the interface we needed through the newly created OOGFeature object.
    summary
        adapter pattern is implemented by creating a new class with desired interface and wrapped the
        original class to do what we actually need to do.

chapter 8 expanding our horizons

    overview
    objects: the traditional view and the new view
        an object is an entity that has responsibilities
    encapsulation:
        encapsulation should be thought as any kind of hiding
    find what is varying and encapsulate it
