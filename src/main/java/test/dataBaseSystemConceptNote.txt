Introduction

    1.1 database-system applications

        enterprise information, banking and finance, universities, airlines, telecommunications

    1.2 purpose of database systems

        storing data in different files and handling them by application programs is called
        file-processing system.It has several disadvantages:

        data redundancy and inconsistency
            same student's info may be appeared different places and modifying one place not
            others causes inconsistency
        difficulty in accessing data
            when need to query specific data,we need to get results from existing list or write
            new program, not convenient.
        data isolation
            files may be different forms
        integrity problems
            consistency constraints are difficult to maintain
        atomicity problems
            it's difficult to ensure atomicity in file-processing systems
        concurrent-access anomalies
        security problems

    1.3 view of data

        1.3.1 data abstraction
            physical level:  how the data is stored
            logical level:   what data is stored
            view level:      only show what is needed

        1.3.2 instances and schemas
            the information stored in the database at one particular moment is called a instance,
            the overall design of the database is called database schema.
            logical schema is most important for it affects application programs directly.

        1.3.3 data models
            relational model
                a collection of tables, record-based models, tables are also called relations
            entity-relationship model
            object-based data model
            semistructured data model
                same type items may have different sets of attributes, like XML

    1.4 database languages

        1.4.1 data-manipulation language(DML)
            procedual DML
            declarative DML
        1.4.2 data-definition language(DDL)
            domain constraints     field type
            referential integrity   reference field must be in accordance
            assertions             more general constraints
            authorization          read,insert,update and delete authorization

            the ouput of DDL is placed in data dictionary, which contains metadata, it is
            only accessed by DMS itself, and DMS will access it before reading or modifyint
            actual data.

    1.5 relational databases

        1.5.1 tables
            easy to guess the physical form of fields and records, and it's easy to duplicate
            the field in different tables.

        1.5.2 data-manipulation language
            sql query one or more tables, returns only one table

        1.5.3 data-definition language
            the schema of a table is an example of metadata.

        1.5.4 database access from application programs
            something needs to be done in general language, not sql,like C,java
            ODBC: Open database connectivity   for C
            JDBC: java database connectivity   for java

    1.6 database design

        1.6.1 design process
            initial phase:
                characterize fully the data needs
            conceptual design:
                know what attributes to gather, and how to group them as tables,
                in this stage,we can know what functional requirements are needed
            logical and physical design stage:
                turn conceptual into physical

        1.6.2 database design for a university organization
        1.6.3 the entity-relationship model
            Unified Modeling Language(UML)
            Entity-Relationship diagram (E-R diagram)
            can also show mapping cardinalities

        1.6.4 normalization
            problems with bad database design:
                repeated information
                unable to represent certain information

    1.7 data storage and querying

        1.7.1 storage Manager
            authorization and integrity manager
            transaction manager
            file manager
                the space allocated in disk and the data structure on it
            buffer manager
                fetch data from disk to memory and decide what data to cache in main memory

            data structures as part of physical implementation
            data files:
                store database itself
            data dictionary:
                metadata about the structure of the database,mainly the schema
            indices:
                can provide fast access to data items, hashing sometimes is faster but not in
                all cases.

        1.7.2 The Query Processor

            DDL interpreter
                interprets DDL statements and store the definition in the data dictionary
            DML compiler
                compile the query to many evalution plans and choose the lowest cost evaluation
                plan.
            Query evaluation engine
                executes low-level instructions generated by DML compiler
