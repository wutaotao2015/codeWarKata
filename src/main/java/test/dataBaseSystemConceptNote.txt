Introduction

    1.1 database-system applications

        enterprise information, banking and finance, universities, airlines, telecommunications

    1.2 purpose of database systems

        storing data in different files and handling them by application programs is called
        file-processing system.It has several disadvantages:

        data redundancy and inconsistency
            same student's info may be appeared different places and modifying one place not
            others causes inconsistency
        difficulty in accessing data
            when need to query specific data,we need to get results from existing list or write
            new program, not convenient.
        data isolation
            files may be different forms
        integrity problems
            consistency constraints are difficult to maintain
        atomicity problems
            it's difficult to ensure atomicity in file-processing systems
        concurrent-access anomalies
