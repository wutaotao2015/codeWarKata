    language processor

        Compiler:        the compiler transfer the source code to target code
        Interpreter:     it can do things directly according to the source code, not via target code.

        compiler's target code is running faster than interpretering,
        however, interpreter is executed line by line,so its error diagnostic effection is better.

        jvm can interpreting  the byteCode, but it also has JIT(just in time) compiler,
        it can compile the bytecode to machine code and then run it.

        because assembly language is easy to debug and output, so it is used as target code of compiler.

    the structure of a compiler

        analysis:       (front end)word components and middle expression,symbol table
        synthesis       (back end)generate the target code according the analysis result

        lexical analysis(scanning)
            transfer the source code to small components:<token-name, attribute-value>
            token name is an abstract symbol,and attribute-value is the serialNo of this item
            in symbol table.
